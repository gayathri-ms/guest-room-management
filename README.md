### ADDITIONAL INFO ABOUT THE PROGRAM
#### History
This project has been done for our our 4th Sem RDBMS Lab. It has been built in accordance with how our Guest House 
operates,and is not as diverse and dynamic as a real guest house. Thus, the project has scope for being implemented 
for a public guest house not related to any institute after certain modifications. Many such tables and related 
sequnces and triggers can be found in the comments of the files in the 
[Database](https://github.com/gayathri-ms/guest-room-management/tree/main/Database) directory.
