# Welcome to GUEST-ROOM-MANAGEMENT
A project for RDBMS Lab 4th sem in 2021.

Dated: 23.03.2021

This project is brought to you by **[Gayathri MS](https://github.com/gayathri-ms)**, 
**[Manas Sahu](https://github.com/Zangetsu112)** and **[Atrik Ray](https://github.com/AtrikGit6174)**.
We are 2nd year CSE students in IIIT Bhubaneswar.

The project intends to provide a solution to implement the IIIT Guest House Management System, 
using a database and web pages to interact with the database.

### SOFTWARE USED
For Database

1. PostgreSQL 10.15
2. pgAdmin 4.30

For Front-end and Back-end

3. Python 3.7 with Bottle framework
4. HTML5 and CSS3

### DEVELOPMENT PLATFORM
* Operating System: Windows 10 and Mac
* Browser used: Google Chrome 89.0.4389.82

### SUPPORTED PLATFORMS
Since it is a local server based project, it can be implemented on any browsers supporting HTML5 and CSS3,
while Python 3.7, PostgreSQL 10.15 and pgAdmin 4.30 require Windows 10 and are not supported on lower 
versions of Windows.

### REPOSITORY DETAILS


### ADDITIONAL INFO ABOUT THE PROGRAM
#### History
This project has been done for our 4th Sem RDBMS Lab. It has been built in accordance with how our Guest House actually
operates, and is less diverse and dynamic than a real guest house. Thus, the project has scope for being implemented 
for a public guest house not related to any institute after certain modifications. Many such tables and related 
sequences and triggers can be found in the comments of the files in the 
[Database](https://github.com/gayathri-ms/guest-room-management/tree/main/Database) directory.

#### ER Diagram
<img src="/Database/Schema%20ERD.PNG">
The ER Diagram has been generated using the “Generate ERD” beta feature of pgAdmin 4.30. It is a rough indicator of the 
relationships between the tables. However, for a complete knowledge of the schema, it is best to look at the schema, 
available at [Schema.sql](https://github.com/gayathri-ms/guest-room-management/blob/main/Database/Schema.sql)

For developers: It is important to first execute the 
[Sequence.sql](https://github.com/gayathri-ms/guest-room-management/blob/main/Database/Sequence.sql) and the 
[Triggers.sql](https://github.com/gayathri-ms/guest-room-management/blob/main/Database/Triggers.sql) before taking in data 
from the front end as they have been used to generate unique primary key codes for each table in the schema.
